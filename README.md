====================

This is my school project for Server Programming class.
This Project is a simple website that has different Roles for managing web content, connected DB, and file uploading functions.
I made this website using: 
Front End: Bootstrap 4, HTML5 and CSS3
Back End: JSP for creating web pages, Apache Tomcat for server and MySQL for database.
